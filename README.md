Bingo App

Hello all! 

This is my very first project in which I wanted to stretch my knowledge with Java. 

I wanted to create an app that automates Bingo to some degree. The idea struck me as I bartend every Bingo night!

My process for learning this was mostly guess and check, paired with some copilot searching, and some AI help. 

I planned out the project in chunks: setting up the sheet as an array, creating the random number generation, creating an input, and lastly scanning for the win condition. I would work on each chunk, then check my work. I found the hardest time I had was getting the "chunks" to work together. This felt like building several machines, that wouldn't chat with eachother. I leaned into my resources to find a solution.
